### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Alex (he/him), a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen, Section of Epidemiology. I like working with prognostic and diagnostic models of adverse outcomes in vulnerable individuals challenged by life-stressors. I am getting excited with longitudinal, time-series data :chart_with_upwards_trend: and very keen to use their signal in prediction. 

Here are some stuff about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the development of predictive models (classic and ML ones) using nationwide registry data. My friend in this, is R, along with tidyverse and tidymodels :heartpulse:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also interested in causal inference, model explainability, fairness and survival analysis.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love logistic regression, restricted cubic splines and have a crash on XGBoost.
