### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Alex (he/him), a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen, Section of Health Data Science & AI. I like working with prognostic and diagnostic models of adverse outcomes in vulnerable individuals. I am getting excited with using data from various modalities and very keen to use their signal in prediction. 

Here are some stuff about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the development of predictive models (classic and ML ones) using data from self-reported questionnaires, nationwide registries, and electronic health records (EHRs). My friend in this, is R, along with tidyverse and tidymodels :heartpulse:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also interested in causal inference, model explainability, fairness and survival analysis.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love logistic regression, restricted cubic splines and have a crash on XGBoost.
